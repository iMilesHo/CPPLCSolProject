I’m preparing for technical interviews. Please provide a systematic review of my solution to the problem below, along with improvements and follow-up practice.

#### 2 · My Code (C++)

```cpp

```

#### 3 · Aspects I’d like you to focus on

1. Time / space complexity analysis, code readability, variable naming, and documentation
2. Code style and C++-specific idioms
3. Common interview follow-ups
4. A 30- to 90-second **elevator pitch** for the solution
   - Explain the algorithm, its complexity, and why it’s efficient in a way that a non-technical person could understand so that I can practice explaining it clearly and concisely in interviews.
5. Any additional optimizations or alternative perspectives (optional)
6. Provide a solution that is great for production.

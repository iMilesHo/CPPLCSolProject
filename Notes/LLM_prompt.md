```

#### 2 · My Code (C++)

```cpp

```

#### 3 · Aspects I’d like you to focus on

1. Correctness, including edge cases
2. Time / space complexity analysis, code readability, variable naming, and documentation
3. Loop or recursion **invariant** derivation and proof
4. Code style and C++-specific idioms (e.g., C++ `const`, move semantics)
5. Common interview follow-ups & harder variants
6. A 30- to 90-second **elevator pitch** for the solution
   - Explain the algorithm, its complexity, and why it’s efficient in a way that a non-technical person could understand so that I can practice explaining it clearly and concisely in interviews.
7. Any additional optimizations or alternative perspectives (optional)
8. Provide a solution that is great for production.
